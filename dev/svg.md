Scalable Vector Graphics
========================

SVG is an internet standard based on XML for vector graphics, understood by most browsers and many other applications.

ELKI uses SVG for visualization and [Batik](/dev/batik) as screen renderer and for conversion to many formats such as postscript and PDF.

The packages [de.lmu.ifi.dbs.elki.visualization.svg](/releases/current/javadoc/elki/visualization/svg/package-summary.html) and [de.lmu.ifi.dbs.elki.visualization.batikutil](/releases/current/javadoc/elki/visualization/batikutil/package-summary.html) include additional code useful for SVG and [Batik](/dev/batik) in particular. See their [JavaDoc](/dev/javadoc) for an overview of the added functionality.

[Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) is an excellent and free graphics program for editing SVG. This is very useful for preparing graphics for printing!

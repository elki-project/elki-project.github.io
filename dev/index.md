ELKI Development
================

Here is some information to start with for developing in the ELKI framework. We're currently collecting information, we'll at some point bring them into a useful order, promised - but please contribute anything you find useful!

-   [JavaDoc](/dev/javadoc) - most of our documentation is provided in the Java documentation.
-   [DBIDs](/dev/dbids) - database objects and high-performance collections for database object references.
-   [DataStore](/dev/data_store) - efficient and high-performance maps for database objects.
-   [Parameterization](/dev/parameterization) - how classes are configured from command line and UI in ELKI.
-   [Benchmarking](/benchmarking) - some notes about using ELKI for benchmarking.
-   [Visualization](/algorithms/visualization) - also see [SVG](/dev/svg) and [Batik](/dev/batik).

-   [DBIDs](./Development/DBIDs) - database objects and high-performance collections for database object references.
-   [DataStore](./Development/DataStore) - efficient and high-performance maps for database objects.
-   [Parameterization](./Parameterization) - how classes are configured from command line and UI in ELKI.
-   [Benchmarking](./Benchmarking) - some notes about using ELKI for benchmarking.
-   [Visualization](./Visualization) - also see [SVG](./SVG) and [Batik](./Batik).

How to do ... in ELKI
=====================

-   [Invoke ELKI from within Java](java_api)
-   [Use index structures for accelerating data mining algorithms](use_indexes)
-   [Process geo data in ELKI](geo_mining)
-   [Perform geo-spatial outlier detection with an external neighborhood specification](geo_outlier_with_external_neighborhood)
-   [Precompute distance matrixes and use external distances](precomputed_distances)
-   [Using sparse vector data](sparse_data)
-   more to come

See also the [Tutorial](/tutorial) section:

-   [Implementing a custom distance function](/tutorial/distance_functions), a variable exponent Minkowski-norm
-   [Implementing a new outlier detection algorithm](/tutorial/outlier), using the distances standard deviation
-   [Implementing a k-means clustering variant](/tutorial/same-size_k_means), producing clusters of the same size

and [Examples](/examples):

-   [Greedy outlier ensemble](/examples/greedy_ensemble) computes a large set of outlier detection methods, then constructs and evaluates a greedy ensemble based on these methods.

-   [Cluster evaluation with segmented view](/examples/cluster_evaluation) detailes the configurations used for the ICDE 2012 demonstration on cluster evaluation.
